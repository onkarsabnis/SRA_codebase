3988,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_22,It would not provide useful information because you would also need to know how much the blue heated up covered to.,0
3989,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_23,Because then you would not be controlling the variables.,1
3990,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_24,Because it did not use all the colors so they could not find out what one heated up more.,0
3991,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_25,Because they have 2 variables changed lid or no lid and color are the 2 they changed.,1
3992,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_26,It would not tell the difference if blue is warmer the red or uncover heat up slower than cover.,1
3993,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_27,Because you are comparing 2 thing and it would not make any sense because you know black heats faster than white.,0
3994,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_28,Because they are the same temperature.,0
3995,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_29,I chose that because when the plastic is darker it will heat faster than a light color.,0
3996,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_30,That will not not provide useful information because you would only know blue covered red uncovered.,1
3997,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_31,Because red uncovered is smaller than the blue covered heater.,0
3998,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_32,Uncovered versus covered would not help but both of each would.,0
3999,refAns_108,"When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.",stuAns_108_33,Because they are both covered.,0

2688,MX_16a,Yes because they both have the same amount of solid.,D-2689,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2689,MX_16a,No because they have the same solid but different amounts of water.,D-2690,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2690,MX_16a,"Yes, the solutions have the same concentration because, using the same solute and water, there is a saturation point per milliliters of water and they have both reached the saturation point, they are saturated and cannot become any more concentrated, so they are both equally concentrated.",D-2691,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",1
2691,MX_16a,"No, they do not because Richard put more water which will make it less concentrated.",D-2692,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2692,MX_16a,No. I think that Mariella's saturated solution is more concentrated because it has more solid.,D-2693,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2693,MX_16a,No because one has more water which will make the solution heavier than the other.,D-2694,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2694,MX_16a,"Yes because if they are saturated, then the stuff on bottom went to waste and the waters are holding the same number of water and solid except for the stuff on the bottom. Take that stuff out then they both have the same concentration.",D-2695,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",1
2695,MX_16a,"No, because the 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because it has less solvent and 250 milliliters of water has more solvent.",D-2696,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2696,MX_16a,"No because if you had Kool-aid the one with more water will give the powder more space to dissolve, but the one with less water will saturate because there is less space for the powder to dissolve.",D-2697,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2697,MX_16a,Yes because they both cannot hold any more solid.,D-2698,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",1
2698,MX_16a,Yes. They are both saturated which means they are also concentrated.,D-2699,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2699,MX_16a,No. Why because one has 3 spoons of salt in it and 2 has 4 spoons of salt in it that is why it is more solution.,D-2700,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2700,MX_16a,"No, because it might be a different amount of the solid in it.",D-2701,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2701,MX_16a,I think yes because it does not matter how much whatever you put in it and they put the same amount of stuff.,D-2702,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2702,MX_16a,"Yes, because if you take out the same amount of water out of each solution and put them on a balance then they will weigh the same. Only a certain amount of water can hold a certain amount of salt.",D-2703,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2703,MX_16a,No it does not because the 250 is more than 100.,D-2704,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2704,MX_16a,Yes because if you take out a certain amount of water out of each of them and weigh them and they will weigh the same.,D-2705,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2705,MX_16a,"No, the one with 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because the solid has less room.",D-2706,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2706,MX_16a,No because Richard has more water than Mariella and Mariella only has 100 milliliters of water. And it is more crowded with 100 milliliters of water.,D-2707,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2707,MX_16a,"No, because Richard has more concentration space than Mariella because he has more water which means less saturation room.",D-2708,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2708,MX_16a,"Yes, because they are both saturated and if they add more it will just become more saturated.",D-2709,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2709,MX_16a,Yes. Because they both put sort of the same amount of water into the cup and so they both have the same concentration.,D-2710,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2710,MX_16a,"No, because Mariella's solution had more water.",D-2711,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2711,MX_16a,Yes there is the same amount of solution.,D-2712,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2712,MX_16a,"No, because if they did then both the water would be the same.",D-2713,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2713,MX_16a,No because Richard has way more solution than Mariella so it is not the same amount.,D-2714,"Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.",0
2714,MX_46b,B has more solute than A does therefore B will weigh more since the solute is equally spread.,D-2715,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2715,MX_46b,They are the same amount of water different in spoons. That is why B weighs more because of spoons.,D-2716,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2716,MX_46b,Because you would have to take 50 milliliters of water out of cup B or else cup B would be heavier. So it would more fair.,D-2717,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2717,MX_46b,I chose cup A because it seems more concentrated.,D-2718,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2718,MX_46b,Because he pour only 50 milliliters of solution in each cup.,D-2719,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2719,MX_46b,Because B is the double of A.,D-2720,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2720,MX_46b,Because cup B has more spoons of the solute and has more water.,D-2721,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2721,MX_46b,"Because if you just took 50 milliliters of water out of each, they would be equal. I got this one wrong.",D-2722,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2722,MX_46b,I think the second one because B has more scoops of solute.,D-2723,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2723,MX_46b,Because now there is now only some of water in each and 4 is more than 2 and cup B more concentration.,D-2724,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2724,MX_46b,I picked cup B because I thought it would have more spoons of solute than cup A.,D-2725,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2725,MX_46b,I pick this one because if you split solution B into 2 water levels it will be 50 so if A is 50 and 2 spoons the other one is going to have to have 2 spoons too because the other one is double.,D-2726,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2726,MX_46b,Because 2 is half of 4 spoons and 50 milliliters is half of 100.,D-2727,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2727,MX_46b,Because Nigel took out the same amount of solutions. There is 2 spoons for 50 milliliters of water. The concentration are the same.,D-2728,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2728,MX_46b,They both have 2 spoonfuls per 50 milliliters so when you compare 50 milliliters from each they both have 2 spoonfuls in the 50 milliliters.,D-2729,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2729,MX_46b,Because they both have the same amount of water but have different amount of salt.,D-2730,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2730,MX_46b,I think cup B would be more heavy because cup B is more concentrated.,D-2731,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2731,MX_46b,They are going to be even.,D-2732,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2732,MX_46b,Cup B is more concentrated than cup A.,D-2733,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2733,MX_46b,Because solution B has more water in the top.,D-2734,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2734,MX_46b,Because if he takes 50 milliliters out of A and puts it back in A it is still the same and if he takes 50 milliliters out of B and puts it back in then they are still both the same.,D-2735,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2735,MX_46b,"They are the same, because there is a pattern, for every 2 spoons of solute add 50 milliliters of water.",D-2736,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2736,MX_46b,B because it gave 100 milliliters water and 4 spoons of solute. And A gave 5 milliliters water 2 spoon of salt so I stay with B.,D-2737,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2737,MX_46b,I chose the same because he took bottle A and half of bottle B and half of bottle B equals A.,D-2738,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2738,MX_46b,It is like x like 50 times 2 equals 100 so then 2 spoons of solute equals 50.,D-2739,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2739,MX_46b,"All solutions are mixtures, and a solution is when something disappears into the other.",D-2740,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2740,MX_46b,Solution would need to be doubled.,D-2741,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2741,MX_46b,Because he took the same amount from each bottle.,D-2742,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2742,MX_46b,Because they both have the same amount of solution in each cup. So both cups weigh the same.,D-2743,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2743,MX_46b,Because there is 2 spoons and 50 milliliters and then there is 4 spoons and 100 milliliters so they are going to weigh the same.,D-2744,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,1
2744,MX_46b,Because there is more water and solute.,D-2745,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2745,MX_46b,I chose that one because in bottle B they took 50 milliliters but in it they put 4 spoons.,D-2746,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2746,MX_46b,I chose this one because in the picture above there is more water in cup B.,D-2747,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2747,MX_46b,Solution B has more water so it weighs more than solution A.,D-2748,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2748,MX_46b,Cup B because it is just double.,D-2749,The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.,0
2749,MX_47b,If you take the same amount of water and weight it will measure to the same things.,D-2750,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",1
2750,MX_47b,I chose cup 2 because it has the same water 2 has more solute.,D-2751,"Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.",0
